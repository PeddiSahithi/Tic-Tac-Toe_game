# Tic-Tac-Toe_game
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in python using numpy.
It asks to enter the names of two players.
Each player marks 'X' or 'O' on the board in their turn by entering the row number and the column number.
A player wins the game by aligning three of their marks ('X' or 'O') either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the game board.
